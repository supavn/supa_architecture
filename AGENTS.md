# Development rules

- Always check for syntax and linting errors after modifying the code
- Always run `dart format` and `dart fix` to fix any fixable issues
- Update changelog as you modified the code

# Testing

- Write semantic test cases, not just "placeholder" test cases
- Write and run the tests when users ask you to do that
